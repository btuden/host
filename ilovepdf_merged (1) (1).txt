(Micro)Economics

In Robbins definition, Economics is the science which studies
human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce
means which have alternative uses.
People make trade-offs and consider opportunity costs in
their decisions.

(Efficient) Allocation
▶ Allocating resources implies choosing. This is the central
topic of Microeconomics: create models that explain
choices.
▶ Typical Framework: Individuals are optimisers. Therefore,
optimisation will be our key technical tool to analyse
choices.
▶ Find the objective

Preferences

The fundamental concept that founds economics is the one of
preferences, i.e. a relation between bundle of goods.
Formally, we write
X ≻Y, X ∼Y, X ≺Y
X here represents a general bundle with as many goods as we
want, but usually we will work in 2 dimensional frameworks
and therefore X = (x1 , x2 ) ∈ R2+

Preferences Assumptions
▶ Completeness:

From preferences to utility
If preferences are rational (i.e. complete and transitive) and
continuous1 , then we can attach to each bundle a number,
therefore constructing the a so-called utility function that
represents the preferences, i.e.
X ≿ Y ⇐⇒ u (X ) ≥ u (Y )
This seems a simple trick, but will simplify a lot handling our
problems, and we will mostly drop preferences and use directly
utility functions. This is why defining the most preferred
object might be harder than defining the highest utility bundle.

1 continuity of preferences guarantee continuity of the utility function

Utility: a graphical perspective
In our 2 dimensional world, utilities are 3-dimensional objects:
the function picks a bundle of 2 goods and attaches to that a
√
number. For example: u (x1 , x2 ) = x1 · x2

u ( x1 , x2 )

Indifference curves
Imagine slicing the utility function horizontally, you obtain the
so called level curves of a function, i.e. the set of point such
that u (x1 , x2 ) = ū. Since all of the points on the curve have
the same utility, we call them indifference curves.

Notable preferences
In economic theory, there are a few preferences/utilities which
are widely used:

▶ Cobb Douglas u (x1 , x2 ) = x1a x2b
▶ Prefect Complements u (x1 , x2 ) = min[x1 , x2 ]
▶ Perfect Substitutes u (x1 , x2 ) = x1 + x2
▶ Quasi Linear u (x1 , x2 ) = v (x1 ) + x2 , where v (·) is a
generic function, can be a log, a square root or a power
▶ Homothetic: family of preferences that satisfy: ifX ≿ Y ,
then tX ≿ tY
Try and draw indifference curves for each of this and ask
yourself what assumptions the underlying preferences satisfy.

Monotonic transformation
One thing to remind about utilities is that they represent
preferences and therefore they are an ordinal concept: we only
care about ordering bundles, not their actual levels of utility.
Then, moving the utility of all bundles up or down in a
smooth way would preserve the order. This is called a
monotonic transformation, i.e. a function g (·) such that
X ≿ Y ⇐⇒ u (X ) ≥ u (Y ) ⇐⇒ g (u (X )) ≥ g (u (Y ))
For example, v (x1 , x2 ) = a logx1 + b logx2 is a monotonic
transformation of a Cobb Doublas because
log u (x1 , x2 ) = log (x1a x2b ) = a logx1 + b logx2
Can you think of other possible monotonic transformations?

Marginal rate of Substitution
Using utilities and indifference curves, we can define a very
important concept, which is the slope of the indifference curve
at a point. In other terms, how we need to swap/trade goods
to remain indifferent. Formally, this object is called the
Marginal rate of substitution and it is computed as follows:
∂u

MRS = −

d x2

= − ∂x
∂u

∂u
We refer to ∂x
as the Marginal utility for good 1, i.e. the
1
additional utility gained by increasing marginally the quantity
of good 1.

October 2023

Reminder

Typical Framework: Individuals are optimisers. Therefore,
optimisation will be our key technical tool to analyse choices.

▶ Find the objective
▶ Define constraints
▶ Find a solution
We introduced the notion of utility. How can we apply it to
explain choices?

Budget Constraint
Constraints usually represent the scarsity of resources.
Simplest resource which is scarse is money, in our terminology,
income.
Assigning prices to goods, we obtain the following budget
constraint
p1 x1 + p2 x2 ≤ m
This represents the set of bundles which are affordable at
income m. Given utility comes only from these two goods,
there is no incentive to save, and therefore we will often
consider the budget constraint with equality, i.e. spending all
the income.
What would happen to the set of affordable bundles (and
graph) if a price increase/decrease? If income
increases/decreases?

Utility Maximisation Problem (UMP)
The standard optimisation problem for utility will then look like
max

u ( x1 , x2 )

s.t.

p1 x1 + p2 x2 ≤ m

x1 ,x2

It means we are looking for an affordable bundle which gives
the highest utility. This bundle will clearly depend on prices
and income.
We call the solution to this problem the Marshallian
demand, as it will represent the optimal quantity demanded
at given prices and income x (p, m ).

touching the budget line.

Computing Marshallian Demand
1- Equimarginal principle

Most of the cases we will work with involves utilities whose
indifference curves are smooth and convex (e.g. Cobb
Douglas).
In this case we can exploit the fact that, at the optimum, the
indifference curve and the budget line will be tangent.
Therefore, their slopes will coincide, giving us the condition
∂u

MRS (x1∗ , x2∗ ) = − pp12 or ∂x∂u1 = pp12
∂x2

And together with this condition, we use the budget constraint
equation (with =).
What if the MRS is greater than the price ratio?

Computing Marshallian Demand
2- Setting up the Lagrangian

A more robust (but longer) method is borrowed from
constrained optimization, in which we construct the
Lagrangian function, i.e.
L = objective function − λ(constraint ),
where λ is the so called Lagrangian multiplier. Therefore,
L(x1 , x2 , λ) = u (x1 , x2 ) − λ(p1 x1 + p2 x2 − m )
And then compute first order conditions as if this was an
unconstrained optimisation.

Computing Marshallian Demand
3- Other cases

There are cases in which neither of the previous cases work:
what to do then? You can always rely on intuition.
For example, with perfect complements,
u (x1 , x2 ) = min{x1 , x2 }
10 x

Budget line: x1 + 2x2 = 8
Utility: u (x1 , x2 ) = min{x1 , x2 }

(x1∗ , x2∗ ) = ( 83 , 83 )

Testing the Model

Clearly, this is theoretical model that aims at explaining
choices, assuming the existence of such thing as a utility
function underlying individual decisions.
We would ideally want to look at data to see if decision would
be consistent with some generic prediction of the model.
Upon observing prices, choice and other bundles (income is
usually not observed as well), we will test two hypothesis on
the Revealed Preferences.

Revealed Preferences
Suppose you can observe prices and choice. What can I say
about the underlying preferences?
The simplest implication is: if I have two available bundles and
I observe that the first is chosen when the second was
affordable, we can say that it is revealed preferred to the
second.
In other terms, if p1 x1 + p2 x2 ≥ p1 y1 + p2 y2 and x is chosen,
it must be that x is (revealed) preferred to y .
If then, at prices q we choose y over z, we say that x is
indirectly preferred to z.

WARP
Weak Axiom of Revealed Preferences

As a fairly mild condition to check our observed choice are in
some manner rational, or more precisely consistent with our
model, we simply demand that if we choose x over y at some
prices p when both are affordable, we can never reverse the
choice at any other price in which both are affordable.
In other terms, if x is chosen over y with
p1 x1 + p2 x2 ≥ p1 y1 + p2 y2 , then if at prices q we observe y
being chosen, it must be that q1 x1 + q2 x2 > q1 y1 + q2 y2 .

SARP
Strong Axiom of Revealed Preferences

As a stronger condition, for a choice to be consistent, we
might require that if we observe A being chosen while B is
affordable, B can never be revealed preferred to A. If also B is
chosen over a third bundle C when both affordable, then C can
never be (indirectly or not) revealed preferred to A.
In a way, we are checking observed choices respect transitivity.

Statics

October 2023

Comparative statics
Economists are interested in capturing evolving phenomena.
Therefore, it is very interesting to study what would happen if
we change some parameters of a model in terms of our
expected outcome, ceteribus paribus.
In our framework, we might want to understand what would
happen to the optimal bundle x ∗ (p, m ) if prices or income
changes. Here, we will study mainly 2 aspects:

▶ Change in Income
▶ Change in own price

Price Elasticity of Demand
An interesting part of the demand function is its slope, i.e.
how fast the demand reacts to a price change.
In particular, we define the Price Elasticity of Demand
(PED) as the ratio of relative changes, (usually referred to in
absolute terms)

Slutsky Decomposition
Let’s look back at the effects of a price change. We can ideally
think to separate two different effect (for a price increase):

▶ Switch consumption towards the second good
→Substitution Effect
▶ Loss of purchase power
→ Income Effect
This idea is called decomposition of the effect on demand of a
price change.
Ideally we want to separate the two effects, so that in the first
only price change and in the second only income change.

Compensated Demand
To eliminate any possible purchase power ”interference”, we
construct a compensated budget line.
Let’s assume the original prices are (p1 , p2 ), the original
demand (x1∗ (p, m ), x2∗ (p, m )) and the new price for good 1 p1′ .
Then
p1 x1∗ + p2 x ∗ = m
p1′ x1∗ + p2 x2∗ = m ′
m ′ represents the income needed to be able to purchase the
initial quantities at new prices. Let (x1′ , x2′ ) be the demand at
prices (p1′ , p2 ) and income m ′ , i.e. the solution to
max(x1 ,x2 ) u (x1 , x2 )
s.t. p1′ x1 + p2 x2 = m ′

Substitution Effect
The difference between the bundle x ∗ and x ′ is the
substitution effect, as the only thing impacting this change is
due to the price change.

Income Effect
As a second step, we can move from x ′ , i.e. the optimal
bundle at new price and adjusted income, to x ′′ , the final
bundle obtained by only moving back the income to its
”natural” level. Therefore, x ′′ is the solution to
max(x1 ,x2 ) u (x1 , x2 )
s.t. p1′ x1 + p2 x2 = m
Then, we define the Income Effect as the difference between
x ′′ and x ′ , as this only depends on the (fictitious) change in
income.

p1 x1∗ + p2 x ∗ = m

m ′ represents the income needed to be able to purchase the
initial quantities at new prices. Let (x1′ , x2′ ) be the demand at
prices (p1′ , p2 ) and income m ′ , i.e. the solution to
max(x1 ,x2 ) u (x1 , x2 )
s.t. p1′ x1 + p2 x2 = m ′

Substitution Effect
The difference between the bundle x ∗ and x ′ is the
substitution effect, as the only thing impacting this change is
due to the price change.

As a second step, we can move from x ′ , i.e. the optimal
bundle at new price and adjusted income, to x ′′ , the final
bundle obtained by only moving back the income to its
”natural” level. Therefore, x ′′ is the solution to
max(x1 ,x2 ) u (x1 , x2 )
s.t. p1′ x1 + p2 x2 = m
Then, we define the Income Effect as the difference between
x ′′ and x ′ , as this only depends on the (fictitious) change in
income.

Lecture 4 - Welfare Anaysis

October 2, 2023

Beyond comparative statics

We studied the implications of parameters change on the
optimal choices.
Now we move to the implications in terms of utility, trying to
establish measures for consumers welfare and its changes.
But since utility is only an ordinal concept, a decrease in utility
by 50 might not be that meaningful. Therefore, we need some
more objective measure for it, and in particular in monetary
terms

Substitution effect - A different perspective

In the Slutsky decomposition, we constructed a compensated
budget line and demand by adjusting the income of the
consumer by keeping their purchase power constant.
We can also think of a different compensated scenario, in
which we can find the compensated demand by computing the
optimal point keeping fixed the utility. This is called the
Hicksian (compensated) demand or Hicksian Substitution
Effect.

Hicksian Demand
Computing Hicksian Demand implies creating a new
framework: we can’t maximise utility if we keep utility fixed!
We can think of ”inverting” the problem, defining it in terms
of expenditure minimisation (EMP): what is the minimum
expense I need to make to secure a certain level of utility ū ?
minx1 ,x2 p1 x1 + p2 x2
s.t. u (x1 , x2 ) = ū
We call the solution h (p, ū ).
Computation: Equimarginal principle (with different
constraint) or Lagrangian.

The optimal point, the hicksian demand, lies on the lowest
budget line touching the Indifference curve constraint.

Duality
It seems there should be some connections between the
solutions to UMP and EMP.
Suppose x is a solution to the UMP problem ant the utility at
this point is v = v (p, m ) = u (x (p, m )), also called the
indirect utility as it depends directly on prices and income.
Then, if we set ū = v and solve the EMP, we will find that
h (p, v ) = x (p, m ) and e (p, v ) = m.
That is, if we set the constraint to the EMP equal to the
maximum utility we could reach with some budget m, it must
be that the bundle that achieves that utility with the smallest
expenditure is the same that maximised utility.
Can you repeat the same argument starting from the hicksian
demand?

Measures of welfare changes - Price change
As a result of a price change, we studied how the optimal
bundle changes (and therefore its utility). How can we
”normalize” the utility change in monetary terms?
We will use 3 ways:

▶ Compensating Variation
▶ Equivalent Variation
▶ Consumer Surplus (this is mostly used for market
demands)
In the following, I will use the underlying case of a price
increase. As an exercise, try to think of the parallel case of a
price decrease.

Compensating variation
In this case, we want to fix the utility at the original (before
price change) one: u (x ∗ (p, m )).
Then, we can ask ourselves how we can adjust the income to
make sure that after the price change the consumer enjoys
the same level of utility as before. Let e (p ′ , u (x ∗ (p, m ))) be
the minimum expenditure needed to achieve the original utility
at final prices, then the Compensating Variation is
CV (p, p ′ , m ) = |m − e (p ′ , u (x ∗ (p, m )))|
Notice that income m can be also expressed as
e (p, u (x ∗ (p, m ))).

In this case, we want to fix the utility at the final (post price
change) one: u (x ∗ (p ′ , m )).
Then, we can ask ourselves how we can adjust the income to
make sure that before the price change the consumer enjoys
the same level of utility as after. Let e (p, u (x ∗ (p ′ , m ))) be
the minimum expenditure needed to achieve the final utility at
original prices, then the Equivalent Variation is
EV (p, p ′ , m ) = |e (p, u (x ∗ (p ′ , m ))) − m |

Consumer’s Surplus
A different approach to measuring welfare change is through
demand function.
Imagine a scenario in which consumers have quasilinear
preferences: u (x1 , x2 ) = v (x1 ) + x2 .
Given some prices p, we can define the consumer surplus as
the net benefit from consuming q1 units of good 1 as
CS (q1 ) = v (q1 ) − p1 q1 .
Then, moving from p1 to p1′ implies a change in Consumer’s
Surplus
∆CS = |v (q1 (p1′ )) − v (q1 (p1 ))|

Consumer’s Surplus
The Consumer’s surplus can be portrayed as the area below
the demand curve (whether it is a single consumer or demand
curve).

Extra: Hicksian Decomposition
We can decompose a price change into hicksian substitution
and income effects.
In this case, the ”intermediate” bundle would be constructed
at new price but keeping the utility constant at the original
level.
Quantitatively it would change the size of the two
components, substitution and income effect, but not the
qualitative results (i.e. signs).
Can you replicate the graph from previous class to this
scenario?

Applications

The usefulness of these measures is that they allow for a clear
comparison between policy. Moreover, using money as a
compensation is a standard method that is widely used.
The cleanest example was last years winter fuel ”subsidy”, in
which housholds received a pay back of £66 per month during
winter months to compensate for the gas price increase.
Would that constitute a payment that leans more towards a
compensating or an equvalent variation?

Lecture 5 - Choice Under
Uncertainty

November 2, 2023

A new framework?

We provided a framework to explain individual choices using
utilities (and preferences).
Can we extend this framework to different scenarios, or is this
framework consistent with different type of decisions?
Let’s test the utility framework when DMs (Decision Makers)
are faced with uncertainty in their outcomes.

What is uncertainty?

Uncertainty relates to missing information, in which the link
between cause and consequence, choices and outcomes, is not
deterministic.
We can work in settings in which DM wouldn’t neither know
the consequences of their actions or the probability attached
to each attainable outcome.
We will focus on risk: situations in which the achievable
outcomes and the probabilities are known by the agents.

Fitting risk into our utility framework

Can we extend preferences (and utilities) to a context of risky
decisions?
The canonical example would be: would you enter a lottery in
which you toss a coin, if it lands on tail you pay £10 and get
£12 otherwise?

The role of expectations
One of the starting point to look at this decision problem
would be the one of expectations. What is the expected
wealth from the previous lottery?
E (w ) =
=

p1 w1 + p2 w2
1
1
2 (−10) + 2 (12) = 1

We can set E (w ) = 0 for the so called outside option, i.e. not
entering the lottery.
But then, since 0.2 > 0, should we conclude that we expect
agents to enter the lottery? Is there more to it?

Expected utility
One possible extension would be to go beyond money per se,
but attach a value/ utility to it. Therefore, we can rewrite the
previous expectation as
1
1
EU (w ) = u (−10) + u (12) =?
2
2
So, even if we set u (0) = 0, the shape or the function u will
determine the choice.
This expression, called the Expected Utility attached to the
previous lottery, can be seen as a utility function over lotteries.
Von Neumann and Morgenstern defined a set of axioms that
guarantee this is an appropriate representations for preferences
over lotteries.

Utility of wealth
What can we say about the shape of the utility of wealth? We
can assume it is an increasing function (monotonicity). In
particular, the rate of increase will be very important.

Certain Equivalent
Another important concept is the one of the Certain
Equivalent, i.e. the certain lottery which is equivalent to the
risky one.
In our previous example, the amount of money to give (or
take) that would make you indifferent between taking the
gamble or that amount. In other words, the CE is an amount
such that
u (CE ) = EU (w ) = pu (w1 ) + (1 − p )u (w2 )
The relation between the certain equivalent and the expected
wealth will give us definitions of risky behaviours.

Risk attitudes
▶ Risk Averse: EU (w ) < u (E (w )) or CE < E (w )
▶ Risk Neutral: EU (w ) = u (E (w )) or CE = E (w )
▶ Risk Lover: EU (w ) > u (E (w )) or CE > E (w )
Notice that these definition rely on the comparison between a
lottery and its expected value. A risk averse agent will prefer
certainty over risk in general, but this comparison holds only
when comparing reasonably similar lotteries (in terms of their
expected outcome).
Can you see the relation between concavity/convexity and risk
attitude?

Lecture 6 - Insurance

November 4, 2023

An example
We saw that risk averse individuals would prefer, under some
conditions, certainty over uncertainty.
Therefore there can be an incentive for individuals to trade
risk.
Suppose we have an individual facing a lottery in which they
lose £50 with 50% chance, the same win √
otherwise and own
£50. Their utility for money it’s u (w ) = w .
On the other hand, we have a risk neutral agent who owns
£50 and faces no risk.
Is there a mutually beneficial trade?

An Example - 2
At the beginning,
EU1 (w ) = 0.5u (wb ) + 0.5u (wg ) = 0.5u (0) + 0.5u (100) = 5
(I use wb for wealth in bad state and wg for wealth in good state)

EU2 (w ) = w = 50
Suppose the two can devise a trade in which the lottery is
transferred to the risk neutral agent in exchange for £10. Now
we have that
√
EU1 (w ) = 40 > 5
EU2 (w ) = 0.5(10) + 0.5(110) = 60
Then, they are both better off!

Insurance

The best real example of this trade is the insurance market.
We can think of insurance firms as big risk neutral agents,
offering contracts for risk averse individuals.
Let’s try and find the optimal demand for insurance through
an example. Suppose the insurance offers the following
contract type: for each pound insured, the agent needs to pay
α. In the case of an event occurring, the insurance will pay
back the insured sum.

Optimal insurance contract
Let’s fix the notation:

▶ k The amount insured
▶ w the value of the insured object
▶ A the potential damage
▶ α the price per insured pound
▶ p the probability of the event that would cause the
damage happening
Therefore, we can find that wg = w − αk and
wb = w − A − αk + k = w − A + (1 − α)k . We can set up
our (expected) utility maximisation:
max EU (k ) = (1 − p ) u (w − αk ) + pu (w − A + (1 − α)k )
k

First Order Condition
dEU (k )
= α(1 − p )u ′ (wg ) − (1 − α)pu ′ (wb ) = 0
dk

(1 − p )u ′ (wg )
(1 − α )
=
′
pu (wb )
α
Notice that the only way we can have constant wealth,
wb = wg is when k = A. We call this situation full
insurance, when the agent insures for the whole potential loss.
To make sure the full insurance is optimal, we need to have
that p = α. We call this a fair price. If the price per unit is
higher than the probability of the bad state, then the agent
will insure less than the whole loss.

Willingness to pay and Risk premium
Different insurance contract don’t give the opportunity to
choose the exact amount you are willing to insure. Instead, an
agent is offered a contract in which there is an annual
premium to be paid, which covers the damage if occurred.
In a simple scenario in which there are only two outcomes, an
agent is willing to pay at most the difference between wg
and the certain equivalent (why?) .
Moreover, we define the risk premium as the the extra
amount of money an agent is willing to pay with respect to a
risk neutral person. This is quantified by the difference
between E (w ) and the certain equivalent.

Asymmetric Information
In real world, the probability of the bad state occurring is not
exogenous, but it is related to some factors specific to the
individual seeking insurance.
The classical example is the one of car insurance: clearly the
probability of an accident is higher for more reckless drivers.
But then, the price they should pay for fair insurance is higher.
What if the insurer can’t tell this when signing the
contract?
This scenario implies that there is some information which is
not transmitted from the insured agent to the insurer, such as
a reckless driver trying to enjoy lower insurance prices by
hiding their behaviour.

Adverse Selection
If the asymmetry in information arises before the contract is
signed, we are in a situation called adverse selection. In this
case, we are in presence of an hidden characteristic.
This problem might not only induce non efficient outcomes,
but to the extreme this might prevent trade in some peculiar
markets (see ”Market for Lemons”).
How is this problem actually solved?

▶ Signaling: the more informed agent might provide
evidence to prove their type
▶ Screening: the less informed agent might ”investigate” to
learn those hidden characteristics

Moral Hazard
If the asymmetry in information arises after the contract is
signed, we are in a situation called moral hazard. In this case,
we are in presence of an hidden action.
For example, after hiring a worker, I might not be fully able to
monitor whether they will do the work required and exert
adequate effort.
How to solve this issue?

▶ Monitoring
▶ Limited liability

Signaling: more issues
As per now, we studied cases in which agents have information
while others don’t. When talking about solving this issue via
signaling, we implicitly assumed agents share information
plainly as they would benefit from it.
What if instead further manipulating the information can be
even more beneficial? For example, a reckless driver might
provide evidence that would portray them as virtuous driver.
But then, the receiver might be induced to believe less in these
signals...
Kamenica and Gentkow (2011) wrote a seminal paper in which
they talk about (Bayesian) Persuasion explaining how
information can be used to maximise someone’s benefit.
